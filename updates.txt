Known Issues:



Notes:

-The old singleton way of handling GameData is no more. According to StackOverflow,
globals are a very bad thing and I should feel bad for using them. I'm not overly
fond of the need to pass in the GameManager object for the BattleLogic and
BattleController to function, but it's the best alternative I could find.


To-Do's:


-Ravioli Ravioli give me the (attack) formuoli

-We're in need of a clean way of delaying the Battle Logic while the enemy attacks.

-We need to come up with a way of knowing which enemy will attack and which target
they will select (Maybe randoms for now?)
